# Huffman Coding Compression

This project implements **Huffman Coding**, a lossless data compression algorithm, using C++. It reads a text input file, builds a frequency map, constructs a Huffman tree, generates prefix codes, and outputs the compressed representation of the original data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- `make`

### Compiling the Project

To compile the project, simply run:

```bash
make
```

### Running the program

After compiling, run the program using:
./huffman input.tsx

input.tsx: This should be a plain text file containing the string you wish to compress.

Output will be printed in the terminal.
